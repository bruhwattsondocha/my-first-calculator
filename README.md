In this project i used everything i knew about JS and also new info i needed just for the purposes of the project  

I'm little proud of my self because i've overdone what i needed to do and made an calculator that respects precedence of operators
Sadly that lead to calculator being more powerful thing than simple one that evaluates only one pair at once, and with that it became
not that complete as for what it pretends to be.  
There are some todos from myself but i think its more rational to continue studying because i'd say i've completed the task, and time will be more well spent on studying new things.
